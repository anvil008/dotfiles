## Background

This is my set of dotfiles which is primarily based around zsh, hyper.js, brewfile. It uses symbolic links to link the files from the dotfiles folder to your home folder.

Bash dotfiles are included based of Mathias's dotfiles (currently not in use). The zsh dotfiles uses the oh-my-zsh framework with custom dotfiles in the custom folder.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
```shell
git clone https://github.com/anvil008/dotfiles.git
```

2. Install node & npm from https://nodejs.org/en/download/
Edit /etc/shells to add a new entry for the Homebrew ZSH.
```shell
sudo vim /etc/shells
```

3. At the end of the file add /usr/local/bin/zsh, which is the path to the Homebrew binary for ZSH. Your /etc/shells should look like this:
```shell
/bin/bash
/bin/csh
/bin/ksh
/bin/sh
/bin/tcsh
/bin/zsh
/usr/local/bin/zsh
```

4. Change the following symbolic link to link your personal private.zsh file (containing private keys) in `setup.sh` file.
```shell
ln -sf ~/Dropbox/Developer/dotfiles/.private
```

5. To run the setup file.
```shell
